# Notes on the Documentation..

### Software development Process model: Evolutionary Development

Due to this development paradigm, a large portion of the documentation files
provide a design and structure that is very different from the actual Implementation.<br>
During the coding process, It was decided to do many things differently from what was originally planned.<br>
This is the nature of evolutionary development....<br>
Regardless, The documentation still provides a lot of useful and critical information
about BugVITa that would otherwise not be possible to explain<br>
<br>
Thank you for reading!<br>
